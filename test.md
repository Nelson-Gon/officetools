# This is  Slide Number one.

- We can make points like this.
 
 **This is bold text**. This makes some *italics*, **nothing fancy**, just `markdown`.

 -------------------------------------------------------------

# **This is another slide**


* We can insert a link to **[manymodelr](https://www.github.com/Nelson-Gon/manymodelr)**
* We can do so many other things, try it out. 
* As an exercise, try adding an image.
